TextMate Tags Readme
====================

Author: Alessandro Vermeulen <alessandrovermeulen@me.com>

Installing
----------

install this hackage package. Then add the following *Preference* to your 
Haskell bundle:

----
{	completionCommand = '#! /bin/sh
SRC_DIR=`cat $TM_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/.srcdir`
PRJ_DIR="$TM_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/$SRC_DIR"

cd $PRJ_DIR
~/.cabal/bin/textmatetags $TM_FILEPATH $TM_CURRENT_WORD'; }
----

Or, if you use the Haskell bundle by Jamis Buck
(http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2005/11/1/haskell-bundle-for-textmate) you can use 
the Haskell bundle provided in this repository. It is a diff to his bundle.

Usage
-----
If your TextMate file is in the root of your source directory, or your TextMate
project has the source folder as its root you are set. If not, place a file
called `.srcdir' in the root of your TextMate project containing on the first
line the location of the source directory relative to the TextMate project
root.
